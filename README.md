# Smoothie Management System

This project is a web application developed using React, HTML, CSS, and Supabase. It serves as a management system for smoothies, allowing users to easily create, edit, and delete smoothie recipes.

### Description:

The Smoothie Management System provides users with a convenient platform to organize and manage their smoothie recipes. Built with React for the frontend interface and HTML/CSS for styling, the application offers a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

Utilizing the Supabase database, the system ensures seamless data management and synchronization. Users can effortlessly add new smoothie recipes, edit existing ones, and delete recipes they no longer need. Real-time updates are reflected across the application and on the Supabase dashboard, ensuring that users always have access to the latest information.

With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, the Smoothie Management System simplifies the process of managing smoothie recipes, making it an ideal choice for smoothie enthusiasts and health-conscious individuals alike. The application will have a smoothies card on which CRUD will be performed.

### Features

- **Smoothie List Display:** On the home page, users can view a list of all currently available smoothies.
- **Edit and Delete Smoothies:** Users can edit the details of each smoothie and delete them as needed.
- **Add New Smoothies:** Users can easily add new smoothies to the system.
- **Real-time Updates:** Any actions performed such as adding, deleting, or updating smoothies are reflected in real-time on the Supabase database dashboard and on the home page of the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
